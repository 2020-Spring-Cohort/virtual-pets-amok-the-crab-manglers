## Virtual Pets Amok

	 Welcome to the Crab Zone virtual pet simulator


	Instructions to play:

	
	- On the start screen select a crab between Bob (Organic) or Charlie (Cyborg)

	- After selecting a crab a menu will display with the following options:

		0. Display stats: This will display their name, type of crab, their health, their hunger/oil level, boredom, and tricks.

		1. Do a trick: This allows the pet to do tricks which reduces boredom by 2.

		2. Feed or oil your pet: This action reduces hunger/oil by 2.

		3. Take (CRAB) to the vet: This action restores health by 20.

		4. Pet your crab: Show your crab some love, watch your fingers!

		5. Return your crab to the shelter: You will be allowed to choose a different pet.
		
		6. Exit game. 

	
	- Allowing hunger to grow, your crab's health will decrease. Keep in mind, the more hunger increases, the more health it loses.

	- Each action will affect the status of your crab.
